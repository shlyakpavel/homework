# My programs for the MIEM HSE
These include:
- IT (previously known as algorithmic computation)
- Alg (introduction to algorithmic computation) 
  - Pascal programs that for laboratory works
  - All my coursera assignments (for educational purposes only!!!)
- History. I didn't upload exam tickets as I didn't get proper permission. Nevertheless, you can find a usefull script to process them.
- Maths, Low, Physics will be also avaible in the future. Don't ask me when.

These do not include:
- My own projects(some of them can be found in external repos)
- My course works (avaible in *appropriate* repos)

## Attention!
Do **NOT** reupload anything if these without my permission! It is potentially **dangerous** as all the assigments are *processed* with plagiarism checker.
